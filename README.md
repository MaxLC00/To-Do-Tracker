# Kanban Task-Board

A web page Kanban taskboard that dynamically tracks projects.

## Description

This page allows users to enter projects, move them around between to-do, in-progress, and done. It also saves project status to storage and changes color to alert of upcoming and past due dates.

## Challenges

My Jquery abilities are far from where I would like them to be, so much of this project is done using guides and code from the jquery website (linked below). I believe that the code could be refactored to be much more efficient.
